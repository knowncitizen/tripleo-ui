    Added a network topology view accessible under the Network Configuration
    step in Deployment plan overview page. The Network topology diagram
    represents Deployment roles, networks and draws connections based on
    roles-networks assignment. The Diagram also shows high level information
    about each network. When you hover over a network, all its connections are
    highlighted for easy identification of assigned Roles.
